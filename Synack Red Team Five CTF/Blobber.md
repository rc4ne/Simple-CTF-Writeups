# CTF NAME - Synack Red Team Five 2021

# DIFFICULTY: EASY 

# SOLUTION:
This was straight forward and had nearly 160 solves. We get string charfromcode encoded file. Now it is possible to do this directly by including in html page, but I just decided to use python and made list of character codes and decoded them to obtain the source code. The code revealed some file, just including it in a simple html page revealed pdf file which had flag.
